### End-to-end example of designing F# code for use by other .NET languages

Consider the following class:

```fsharp
open System

type Point1(angle,radius) =
    new() = Point1(angle=0.0, radius=0.0)
    member x.Angle = angle
    member x.Radius = radius
    member x.Stretch(l) = Point1(angle=x.Angle, radius=x.Radius * l)
    member x.Warp(f) = Point1(angle=f(x.Angle), radius=x.Radius)
    static member Circle(n) =
        [ for i in 1..n -> Point1(angle=2.0*Math.PI/float(n), radius=1.0) ]
```

The inferred F# type of this class is as follows:

```fsharp
type Point1 =
    new : unit -> Point1
    new : angle:double * radius:double -> Point1
    static member Circle : n:int -> Point1 list
    member Stretch : l:double -> Point1
    member Warp : f:(double -> double) -> Point1
    member Angle : double
    member Radius : double
```

Let's take a look at how this F# type appears to a programmer using another .NET language. For example, the approximate C# "signature" is as follows:

```csharp
// C# signature for the unadjusted Point1 class
public class Point1
{
    public Point1();

    public Point1(double angle, double radius);

    public static Microsoft.FSharp.Collections.List<Point1> Circle(int count);

    public Point1 Stretch(double factor);

    public Point1 Warp(Microsoft.FSharp.Core.FastFunc<double,double> transform);

    public double Angle { get; }

    public double Radius { get; }
}
```

There are some important points to notice about how F# represents constructs here. For example:

* Metadata such as argument names has been preserved.

* F# methods that take two arguments become C# methods that take two arguments.

* Functions and lists become references to corresponding types in the F# library.

The following code shows how to adjust this code to take these things into account.

```fsharp
namespace SuperDuperFSharpLibrary.Types

type RadialPoint(angle:double, radius:double) =

    /// Return a point at the origin
    new() = RadialPoint(angle=0.0, radius=0.0)

    /// The angle to the point, from the x-axis
    member x.Angle = angle

    /// The distance to the point, from the origin
    member x.Radius = radius

    /// Return a new point, with radius multiplied by the given factor
    member x.Stretch(factor) =
        RadialPoint(angle=angle, radius=radius * factor)

    /// Return a new point, with angle transformed by the function
    member x.Warp(transform:Func<_,_>) =
        RadialPoint(angle=transform.Invoke angle, radius=radius)

    /// Return a sequence of points describing an approximate circle using
    /// the given count of points
    static member Circle(count) =
        seq { for i in 1..count ->
                RadialPoint(angle=2.0*Math.PI/float(count), radius=1.0) }
```

The inferred F# type of the code is as follows:

```fsharp
type RadialPoint =
    new : unit -> RadialPoint
    new : angle:double * radius:double -> RadialPoint
    static member Circle : count:int -> seq<RadialPoint>
    member Stretch : factor:double -> RadialPoint
    member Warp : transform:System.Func<double,double> -> RadialPoint
    member Angle : double
    member Radius : double
```

The C# signature is now as follows:

```csharp
public class RadialPoint
{
    public RadialPoint();

    public RadialPoint(double angle, double radius);

    public static System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<RadialPoint> Circle(int count);

    public RadialPoint Stretch(double factor);

    public RadialPoint Warp(System.Func<double,double> transform);

    public double Angle { get; }

    public double Radius { get; }
}
```

The fixes made to prepare this type for use as part of a vanilla .NET library are as follows:

* Adjusted several names: `Point1`, `n`, `l`, and `f` became `RadialPoint`, `count`, `factor`, and `transform`, respectively.

* Used a return type of `seq<RadialPoint>` instead of `RadialPoint list` by changing a list construction using `[ ... ]` to a sequence construction using `IEnumerable<RadialPoint>`.

* Used the .NET delegate type `System.Func` instead of an F# function type.

This makes it far nicer to consume in C# code.
