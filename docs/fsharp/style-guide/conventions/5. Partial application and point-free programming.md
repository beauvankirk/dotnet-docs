## Partial application and point-free programming

F# supports partial application, and thus, various ways to program in a point-free style. This can be beneficial for code reuse within a module or the implementation of something, but it is not something to expose publicly. In general, point-free programming is not a virtue in and of itself, and can add a significant cognitive barrier for people who are not immersed in the style.

### Do not use partial application and currying in public APIs

With little exception, the use of partial application in public APIs can be confusing for consumers. Usually, `let`-bound values in F# code are **values**, not **function values**. Mixing together values and function values can result in saving a small number of lines of code in exchange for quite a bit of cognitive overhead, especially if combined with operators such as `>>` to compose functions.

### Consider the tooling implications for point-free programming

Curried functions do not label their arguments. This has tooling implications. Consider the following two functions:

```fsharp
let func name age =
    printfn "My name is {name} and I am %d{age} years old!"

let funcWithApplication =
    printfn "My name is %s and I am %d years old!"
```

Both are valid functions, but `funcWithApplication` is a curried function. When you hover over their types in an editor, you see this:

```fsharp
val func : name:string -> age:int -> unit

val funcWithApplication : (string -> int -> unit)
```

At the call site, tooltips in tooling such as Visual Studio will not give you meaningful information as to what the `string` and `int` input types actually represent.

If you encounter point-free code like `funcWithApplication` that is publicly consumable, it is recommended to do a full Î·-expansion so that tooling can pick up on meaningful names for arguments.

Furthermore, debugging point-free code can be challenging, if not impossible. Debugging tools rely on values bound to names (for example, `let` bindings) so that you can inspect intermediate values midway through execution. When your code has no values to inspect, there is nothing to debug. In the future, debugging tools may evolve to synthesize these values based on previously executed paths, but it's not a good idea to hedge your bets on *potential* debugging functionality.

### Consider partial application as a technique to reduce internal boilerplate

In contrast to the previous point, partial application is a wonderful tool for reducing boilerplate inside of an application or the deeper internals of an API. It can be helpful for unit testing the implementation of more complicated APIs, where boilerplate is often a pain to deal with. For example, the following code shows how you can accomplish what most mocking frameworks give you without taking an external dependency on such a framework and having to learn a related bespoke API.

For example, consider the following solution topography:

```
MySolution.sln
|_/ImplementationLogic.fsproj
|_/ImplementationLogic.Tests.fsproj
|_/API.fsproj
```

`ImplementationLogic.fsproj` might expose code such as:

```fsharp
module Transactions =
    let doTransaction txnContext txnType balance =
        ...

type Transactor(ctx, currentBalance) =
    member _.ExecuteTransaction(txnType) =
        Transactions.doTransaction ctx txtType currentBalance
        ...
```

Unit testing `Transactions.doTransaction` in `ImplementationLogic.Tests.fsproj` is easy:

```fsharp
namespace TransactionsTestingUtil

open Transactions

module TransactionsTestable =
    let getTestableTransactionRoutine mockContext = Transactions.doTransaction mockContext
```

Partially applying `doTransaction` with a mocking context object lets you call the function in all of your unit tests without needing to construct a mocked context each time:

```fsharp
namespace TransactionTests

open Xunit
open TransactionTypes
open TransactionsTestingUtil
open TransactionsTestingUtil.TransactionsTestable

let testableContext =
    { new ITransactionContext with
        member _.TheFirstMember() = ...
        member _.TheSecondMember() = ... }

let transactionRoutine = getTestableTransactionRoutine testableContext

[<Fact>]
let ``Test withdrawal transaction with 0.0 for balance``() =
    let expected = ...
    let actual = transactionRoutine TransactionType.Withdraw 0.0
    Assert.Equal(expected, actual)
```

This technique should not be universally applied to your entire codebase, but it is a good way to reduce boilerplate for complicated internals and unit testing those internals.
